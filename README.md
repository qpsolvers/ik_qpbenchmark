# IK test set for QP solvers

This repository contains quadratic programs (QPs) arising from differential inverse kinematics in robotics, in a format suitable for [qpbenchmark](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark). Here is the report produced by this benchmarking tool:

- üìà <a href="results/ik_qpbenchmark.md"><strong>IK test set results</strong></a> (‚ö†Ô∏è work in progress: still crunching the 2,592,000 solver calls of the test set)

## Installation

The recommended process is to install the benchmark and all solvers in an isolated environment using `conda`:

```console
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ik_qpbenchmark
```

It is also possible to install the benchmark [from PyPI](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#installation).

## Usage

Run the test set as follows:

```
python ./ik_qpbenchmark.py run
```

The outcome is a standardized report comparing all available solvers against the different [benchmark metrics](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#metrics). You can check out and post your own results in the [Results forum](https://github.com/qpsolvers/ik_qpbenchmark/discussions/categories/results).
